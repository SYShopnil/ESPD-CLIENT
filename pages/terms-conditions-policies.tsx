						<h4>Terms, Conditions, Policies and Protocols</h4>
						<p>
							All tutors are briefed and sign agreements on safeguarding, data protection regulations,
							professional work history, acceptable use of ICT and conduct guidance before being
							permitted to work with students through ESPD.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							As trained, qualified and experienced teachers, we understand the centrality of safeguarding
							and taking steps to ensure that the relationships between our students, parents/carers and
							tutors are built on self actualisation, trust and the highest and best educational achievement
							and exam success. We are proud to have in place a sufficiently robust set of policies and
							protocols which are designed to ensure students, parents/carers and tutors can be safe and
							enjoy contributing to good progress.
						</p>

						<h4>Safeguarding policy</h4>
						<p>
							1. Presence of Parents/Guardians<br/>
							<br/>
							A parent/carer/responsible adult must be present if students are under 18, at least at the
							start of the lesson. Tutors may request that the parent/carer / responsible adult remains for
							the entirety of the lesson.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							Tutors may cancel lessons if no parent/carer/responsible adult is present during a lesson with a student who is under 18 or if they or the learner do not feel comfortable to continue with the lesson.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							The parent/carer/responsible adult will ensure the student understands this safeguarding
							policy and will always be responsible for the welfare of the student during the tutorial.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							2. Safeguarding breaches<br/>
							<br/>
							Any student or tutor reported for a serious breach of this safeguarding policy will be
							immediately suspended from ESPD until the matter reported has been investigated.
							Outstanding lessons may be cancelled.<br/>
							<br/>
							Any illegal activity undertaken by students or tutors that comes to the attention of ESPD
							through any means may lead to tutors and/or students being excluded permanently from
							ESPD and reported to the police or other relevant organisations. ESPD will fully co-operate
							with UK law enforcement agencies in sharing any evidence that may be requested of us by
							such agencies.<br/>
							<br/>
							ESPD reserves the right to discretion in resolving minor breaches of the safeguarding policy.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							3. Declarations<br/>
							<br/>
							It is entirely at the student/parent/carer’s discretion to check any claims made by the tutor
							or by ESPD regarding the tutor’s credentials in their first tutorial with a tutor. The
							parent/carer will be responsible for the selection of the tutor and checking his/her relevant
							credentials.<br/>
							<br/>
							Tutors of modern foreign languages (MFL) may not be qualified from universities or
							teaching practice centres in the UK e.g. a tutor who teaches Italian may have qualified from
							a university or teaching practice centre in Italy and a tutor who teaches German may have
							qualified from a university or teaching practice centre in Germany etc.<br/>
							<br/>
							ESPD may take legal action against any tutor who does not honestly declare, or
							mis-declares the status of their background checks, credentials, qualifications and/or
							history.<br/>
							<br/>
							4. Conduct and communication<br/>
							<br/>
							All communication between students, parents/carers and tutors must be positive,
							respectful and free from discrimination. Once initial pleasantries are succinctly over with, all
							communication must be focused on improving the exam success and learning outcomes of
							the student.<br/>
							<br/>
							No improper suggestions or requests should be made by either the student, parent/carer or
							by the tutor. Examples of such suggestions include requesting to meet in person for
							tutoring. We are a strictly online tutoring service and any suggestion to this effect will be
							considered a serious breach of this safeguarding policy.<br/>
							<br/>
							Tutors are bound not to discuss their political or religious beliefs so should not be asked to
							do so.<br/>
							<br/>
							No personal contact details are to be exchanged between tutors, parents/carers and
							students. This includes all and any social media contact details.<br/>
							<br/>
							Parents/carers will report any unsolicited communication between students and tutors
							outside of booked tutorials.<br/>
							<br/>
							The booking party (student or parent/carer) must fill out the booking form correctly and give
							the tutor enough information regarding which area of the curriculum subject the student
							requires support with. This communication will enable the tutor to plan and deliver the most
							effective tutorial.
							<br/>
							Tutors agree to students and parents/carers being able to create events in their Google Calendar application by booking tutorials. Students and parents/carers agree to events being created in their Google Calendar application when they book tutorials with ESPD.

						</p>
						<h4>Tutorial Protocols</h4>
						<p>The following is to be considered in addition to the above;<br/>
							<br/>
							6. Student background and location<br/>
							<br/>
							It is preferable to teach students in neutral areas of the house, such as a living room,
							kitchen, or conservatory. However, it is understood that this may not always be the best
							environment for learning, especially if there are younger siblings or pets within earshot, for
							example. In such cases, it may be better for the student to move to a more private and
							quieter area, such as a bedroom. As stated above, and in the in the interests of
							safeguarding and promoting positive educational relationships between tutors, parents and
							students, we ask a parent/guardian/responsible adult to be present at least at the start of
							the tutorial and communicate to the tutor that they are comfortable for their
							son/daughter/ward to be tutored.<br/>
							<br/>
							7. Student light, sound and camera<br/>
							<br/>
							Students and tutors should be well lit as dark imagery is less conducive to open, positive
							and professional learning and teaching exchanges.<br/>
							<br/>
							Students and tutors must be clearly visible and audible via either a suitably clear built in or
							external laptop/desktop camera and microphone. Tutors are not permitted to wear large
							over ear headphones, which are also best avoided by students.<br/>
							<br/>
							8. Student dress code<br/>
							<br/>
							Tutors working through ESPD are briefed and sign to adhere consistently to a professional
							dress code. Whilst we do not expect students to dress as formally as tutors, our
							commitment to personal development and cultivating and maintaining a sense of
							professionalism and positive personal presentation means that we will not teach students
							in pyjamas.<br/>
							<br/>
							9. Cancellations<br/>
							<br/>
							Lessons can be cancelled by emailing your tutor and/or hello@espd.school. Please tell us who your tutorial is with and what time it is due to start.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							Lessons cancelled with less than 4 hours notice may incur a penalty of ten pounds before full refund. This is at the discretion of the tutor.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							If more than 4 hours notice is given, the tutorial can be rescheduled to another time once. There will be no penalty to receive tuition at this rescheduled time.
						</p>
						<h4>Marketing</h4>
						<p>
							Responding to our social media advertising or booking a tutorial with us requires email submission. Your email may be included in our mailing list. You have the right to unsubscribe and be forgotten, as per our privacy policy.



						</p>
						<h4>Legal terms</h4>
						<p>The following is to be considered in addition to the above; <br/>
							Tutors are not employees of ESPD and are solely responsible for their own actions. <br/>
							When a tutorial is confirmed, the booking party (student over 18 or parent/carer) enters into
							a direct contract with the tutor for the provision of lessons. ESPD is not liable for the tutor’s
							provision of lessons.<br/>
							<br/>
							In no event will ESPD be liable for any financial losses, impact to reputation, special, indirect
							or consequential losses or damage to or loss of data</p>
